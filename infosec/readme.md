## What is InfoSec ?
InfoSec refers to Information Security. Information Security is the process of protecting an organization data from unauthorised access or modification.

## CIA Triad:
There are three main part of InfoSec:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

### Confidentiality
The organization data must be confidential. Only the user can access those data by using a end to end encryption method or 2fa. So, InfoSec secured the organization data.
### Integrity
Integrity means all the data must be valid and proper checked and sanitized. Consistency includes protection against unauthorized changes (additions, deletions, alterations, etc.) to data. It makes the organization trustworthy. So Integrity is one of the most important part of InfoSec.
### Availability
After Confidentiality and Integrity then comes to Availability. Availability is the protection of a systemâ€™s ability to make software systems and data fully available when a user needs it (or at a specified time). Users and organization should have run the system without any errors or issues. And the system should be available to use.
