## What is InfoSec ?
InfoSec refers to Information Security. Information Security is the process of protecting an organization data from unauthorised access or modification.

## CIA Triad:
There are three main part of InfoSec:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

### Confidentiality
The organization data must be confidential. Only the user can access those data by using a end to end encryption method or 2fa. So, InfoSec secured the organization data.
### Integrity
Integrity means all the data must be valid and proper checked and sanitized. Consistency includes protection against unauthorized changes (additions, deletions, alterations, etc.) to data. It makes the organization trustworthy. So Integrity is one of the most important part of InfoSec.
### Availability
After Confidentiality and Integrity then comes to Availability. Availability is the protection of a systemâ€™s ability to make software systems and data fully available when a user needs it (or at a specified time). Users and organization should have run the system without any errors or issues. And the system should be available to use.

## Fundamental Concept Of Security
There are three fundamental concept of security:
- Vulnerability : A vulnerability exposes your organization to threats.
- Threat : A threat is a malicious or negative event that take advantages of a vulnerability.
- Risk : It is the potential loss and damage when the threat does occur.

### Vulnerability
A vulnerability is a weakness, flaw, or other shortcoming in a system(infrastructure, database, or software), but it can also exist in a process,a set of controls, or simply just the way that something has been implemented or deployed.
There are two general type of vulnerabilities:
- Technical Vulnerabilities: Bugs in code, error in some hardware or software.
- Human Vulnerabilities: Data theft from employee or employee for for phishing.

### Threat
Anything that could exploit or take advantage of vulnerability is called threat. Any malicious or negative that could exploit the vulnerability is also called threat.

### Risk
For vulnerability and threat the potential physical or digital loss is called risk. The calculation of risk is depend on threat and vulnerability. We can calculate or assume total risk by multiply vulnerability with threat.
```
risk = vulnerability * threat
```
